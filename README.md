Shakespearen Monkey written in crude p5.js

# Implementation Details

Yet another old program from 2020.

This one is cool because it uses a genetic algorithm to evolve and produce a target phrase.

Oh and the code is actually very neat and tidy (I'm as surprised as you are), so you can just look through it to understand what's going on.

The basic heirarchy is: `sketch.js` --> `population.js` --> `dna.js` --> `gene.js`.

I'll update this README later in the future.
